 Step 1: Next.js 15 with Page Router
    i) The application is built using Next.js version 15.
    ii) Iâ€™ve used the Page Router approach to manage routing between different pages (/signin, /signup, /home).

Step 2: Authentication Using localStorage
    i) User data  is stored and validated using localStorage
    ii) On signup, user credentials are saved in localStorage.
    iii) On signin, credentials are verified against the stored data.

Step 3: Notes CRUD Operations on Home Page
    i) View their notes.
    ii) Add a new note.
    iii) Edit/Update an existing note.
    iv) Delete any note.

Step 4: Protected Route for Home Page
    i) A condition is added to redirect users to /signin if they try to access the /home page without logging in.
    ii)This is done using localStorage.getItem("users").

Step 5: User-Specific Notes
    i) I am updating the logic to ensure each user sees only their own notes.
    ii) This can be done by saving notes in localStorage with a key tied to the username like
     localStorage.setItem(`${username}_notes`, JSON.stringify(notes));
